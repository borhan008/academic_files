\section{Requirement analysis}
This section focuses on analyzing the system requirements using various modeling techniques to understand and document how the system will function and interact with users and data.

\subsection{Flow Models}
Flow models use Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) to represent the flow of data within the system, illustrating processes, data stores, external entities, and data flows.

\noindent \textbf{(i) Level 0 DFD} \\
A Level 0 DFD, also known as a context diagram, provides a high-level overview of the entire system as a single process interacting with external entities (e.g., users, admins, employees). 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{photos/dfd-0.png}
    \caption{Level 0 DFD}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

\noindent \textbf{(ii) Level 1 DFD} \\
A Level 1 DFD decomposes the single process from the Level 0 DFD into major subprocesses, showing how data flows between them. 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{photos/dfd-0.png}
    \caption{Level 1 DFD}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

\noindent \textbf{(iii) Level 2 DFD} \\
A Level 2 DFD further decomposes one or more processes from the Level 1 DFD into finer subprocesses.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Class-Based Models}
Class-based models focus on the structural aspects of the system, defining entities, their attributes, relationships, and responsibilities.
\\ \\ 
\noindent \textbf{(i) Entity-Relationship Diagram} \\
An Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram represents the database structure of the system, showing entities , their attribute, and relationships.
\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{ER Diagram}

\end{figure}



 \noindent \textbf{(i) Class Diagram} \\
A UML Class Diagram models the systemâ€™s classes, their attributes, methods, and relationship.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{photos/class-diagram}
    \caption{Class Diagram}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

 \noindent \textbf{(iii) Class-Responsibility Collaboration (CRC) Modeling} \\
CRC (Class-Responsibility-Collaboration) modeling identifies classes, their responsibilities (what they d), and collaborators (other classes they interact with).

\subsection{Project Estimation}
This section provides detailed estimates for the development of the Complaint Management System, tailored to a team of two members and a project of moderate complexity. The estimates include product size, effort, schedule, and cost, with justifications rooted in industry standards.
\\ \\ 
\textbf{Product Size} \\
The product size is estimated based on the system's scope, which includes 9 classes (e.g., User, Complaint, Department) with approximately 50 methods and 50 attributes, as derived from the class diagram and CRC model. Using the Lines of Code (LOC) metric, the system is projected to require 4000â€“5000 LOC, reflecting a moderate-sized application for a lab project. Alternatively, using Function Points (FP), an estimate of 30â€“40 FP is appropriate, considering the number of entities and basic functionalities such as complaint filing and user management. This range is justified by the system's limited scope, avoiding advanced features, and aligning with typical academic project sizes.

\textbf{Effort}\\
Effort is calculated using the COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model) basic model for organic projects, where Effort = a $\times$ (Size)$^b$, with $a = 2.4$ and $b = 1.05$. Assuming a size of 35 FP (midpoint of 30â€“40 FP), the effort is:
\[
\text{Effort} = 2.4 \times (35)^{1.05} \approx 87 \text{ person-hours}.
\]
For a team of two members, this translates to approximately 43.5 person-hours per member. Given a 20-hour workweek per member over the 57-day schedule, the total effort is adjusted to 5â€“6 person-months (assuming 160 hours per month), reflecting the project's moderate complexity and the team's small size. This adjustment accounts for learning curves and part-time commitment typical in a lab setting.

\textbf{Schedule}\\
The project schedule, determined by the Critical Path Method (CPM), is set at 57 days, starting from May 1, 2025, and ending on July 4, 2025. This duration encompasses all tasks, including requirement analysis, design, development, testing, and deployment, as outlined in the WBS and Gantt chart. The schedule is justified by the critical path's longest sequence (e.g., requirements to complaints module to testing), ensuring a realistic timeline for a two-member team with overlapping tasks like UML development and database design.

\textbf{Cost}\\
The cost is estimated based on the effort and an hourly rate suitable for a student project. Assuming a rate of \$15 per hour (reflecting a reasonable student or intern wage in 2025), and a total effort of 87 hours, the cost is:
\[
\text{Cost} = 87 \times 15 = \$1,305.
\]



\section{Risk Analysis}

This section identifies potential risks associated with the development of the Complaint Management System and outlines a Risk Mitigation, Monitoring, and Management (RMMM) plan to address them, tailored to a two-member team in an academic lab setting.

\subsection{Identify Risks (SWOT Analysis)}

A SWOT analysis evaluates the project's internal Strengths and Weaknesses, as well as external Opportunities and Threats.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Strengths}: The team consists of two motivated students with basic software engineering knowledge, enabling efficient collaboration. The project's scope is well-defined through class modeling and project planning, providing a clear roadmap.
    \item \textbf{Weaknesses}: Limited team size (two members) may lead to workload imbalances or delays if one member is unavailable. Inexperience with complex integrations (e.g., notifications) could result in technical errors.
    \item \textbf{Opportunities}: The project offers a chance to gain practical experience with UML, DFDs, and project management tools, potentially enhancing skills for future courses or internships. Feedback from the instructor can improve the system design.
    \item \textbf{Threats}: Tight deadlines may pressure the team, risking incomplete testing. Unforeseen technical issues or resource constraints (e.g., limited access to tools) could hinder progress.
\end{itemize}

These factors highlight the need for proactive risk management to ensure successful project completion.

\subsection{ RMMM Plan}

The RMMM plan addresses identified risks with specific strategies for mitigation, monitoring, and management.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Risk 1: Workload Imbalance Due to Small Team Size}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Mitigation}: Divide tasks evenly based on the WBS (e.g., one member handles design, the other development), with weekly progress reviews to reallocate if needed.
        \item \textbf{Monitoring}: Track task completion using a shared schedule (e.g., Gantt chart), checking progress every 3 days.
        \item \textbf{Management}: If one member falls behind, adjust deadlines or seek assistance from the instructor by May 17, 2025.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Risk 2: Technical Errors in Integrations (e.g., Notifications)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Mitigation}: Conduct unit testing for each module (e.g., User, Notification) early, using mock data to simulate interactions.
        \item \textbf{Monitoring}: Review integration test results by June 12, 2025, to identify issues.
        \item \textbf{Management}: Allocate extra time (e.g., 2 days) during the testing phase (June 4â€“11, 2025) to debug and consult online resources or peers if errors persist.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Risk 3: Tight Deadline Pressure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Mitigation}: Prioritize critical path tasks (e.g., Complaints module) and complete non-critical tasks (e.g., UI mockups) in parallel.
        \item \textbf{Monitoring}: Assess progress against the 57-day schedule weekly, with a final check by May 17, 2025.
        \item \textbf{Management}: If delays occur, focus on core functionalities (e.g., complaint filing) and document limitations for submission.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Risk 4: Unforeseen Technical Issues or Resource Constraints}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Mitigation}: Set up a basic development environment (e.g., LaTeX, Inkscape) and test database connectivity by May 10, 2025.
        \item \textbf{Monitoring}: Check tool availability and system performance during the design phase (May 10â€“14, 2025).
        \item \textbf{Management}: Request institutional support (e.g., software licenses) or extend testing time (e.g., June 12â€“17, 2025) if issues arise.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This RMMM plan ensures risks are addressed systematically, aligning with the project's timeline and team capacity.
