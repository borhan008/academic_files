# Taking Notes

## Notion
Notion is a digital note-taking tool that you can use to organize your study materials efficiently.  
Create an account using your **.nstu.edu** email address to access the **student version**, which includes many premium features.

### Features
- Easy to use and maintain
- Easy to share notes with others using live links
- Export notes as PDF,HTML etc. files
- Write mathematical equations using **LaTeX / KaTeX**


## Obsidian
Obsidian is a local note-taking application that works offline. It is somewhat similar to Notion, but you cannot share notes as live pages like in Notion.  
Apart from that, most features are similar.


## LaTeX
You may have noticed that research papers and academic documents often have high-quality formatting. These are usually created using **LaTeX**.

If you want to create such documents, you can sign in to **Overleaf** and explore its features.  
There are also other platforms available for creating LaTeX documents, such as **TeXPage**.
